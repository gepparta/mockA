ZAKE_MOCKA is needed by contributors of mockA.
ZAKE_MOCKA extracts the mockA source code as slinkee files to the specified output folder (check EXPORT-option and specify LOCLPATH)

All other users (non-contributors) may use the build nugget file which can be found at mockA_build/mockA_daily.nugg. 
The nugget file can be imported using SAPLink.

As it requires ZAKE which needs to be installed separately, it is not part of the mockA delivery
